![GitHound](./Documentation/images/github_bloodhound.png)

## Overview

**GitHound** is a BloodHound OpenGraph collector for GitHub, designed to map your organization’s structure and permissions into a navigable attack‑path graph. It:

- **Models Key GitHub Entities**  
  - **GH_Organization**: Your GitHub org metadata  
  - **GH_User**: Individual user accounts in the org  
  - **GH_Team**: Teams that group users for shared access  
  - **GH_Repository**: Repositories within the org  
  - **GH_Branch**: Named branches in each repo  
  - **GH_OrgRole**, **GH_TeamRole**, **GH_RepoRole**: Org‑, team‑, and repo‑level roles/permissions  

- **Visualize & Analyze in BloodHound**  
  - **Access Audits**: See at a glance who has admin/write/read on repos and branches  
  - **Compliance Checks**: Validate least‑privilege across teams and repos  
  - **Incident Response**: Trace privilege escalations and group memberships  

With GitHound, you get a clear, interactive graph of your GitHub permissions landscape—perfect for security reviews, compliance audits, and rapid incident investigations.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [BloodHound Docs - GitHound](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/opengraph/extensions/githound).

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Load the collector
. ./githound.ps1

# 2. Create a session with your Personal Access Token
$session = New-GitHubSession -OrganizationName "YourOrgName" -Token (Get-Clipboard)

# 3. Run the collection
Invoke-GitHound -Session $session

# 4. Upload the resulting githound_<orgId>.json file to BloodHound
```

If collection is interrupted, resume from where you left off:

```powershell
Invoke-GitHound -Session $session -Resume
```

## GitHub App Sessions

GitHound supports both Personal Access Token sessions and GitHub App installation sessions.
The existing organization-scoped GitHub App workflow is unchanged:

```powershell
. ./githound.ps1

$session = New-GitHubJwtSession `
  -OrganizationName "YourOrgName" `
  -ClientId $clientId `
  -PrivateKeyPath $privateKeyPath `
  -InstallationId $installationId

Invoke-GitHound -Session $session -CollectAll
```

The same function can also create enterprise-capable sessions:

```powershell
. ./githound.ps1

$session = New-GitHubJwtSession `
  -EnterpriseName "YourEnterpriseSlug" `
  -ClientId $clientId `
  -PrivateKeyPath $privateKeyPath `
  -InstallationId $installationId `
  -PersonalAccessToken $pat
```

Enterprise-capable sessions retain multiple auth contexts on the returned `GitHound.Session`:

- `Headers`: the GitHub App installation token headers used for normal collection
- `JwtHeaders`: GitHub App JWT headers used for app-level endpoints such as installation enumeration
- `PatHeaders`: optional Personal Access Token headers for collection paths that require user-token auth

To enumerate the installations that belong to the authenticated GitHub App:

```powershell
Get-GitHubAppInstallation -Session $session |
  Select-Object TargetType, InstallationId, Login, Name, SuspendedAt
```

## Workflow Analysis

Workflow parsing is now built into `Invoke-GitHound` when you use `-CollectAll`. The collector
will:

- collect raw `GH_Workflow` nodes and workflow contents
- analyze those workflows into `GH_WorkflowJob` and `GH_WorkflowStep`
- compute `GH_CanPwnRequest` and `GH_CanDispatchTo`
- merge the results into the normal consolidated `githound_<orgId>.json` output

For resume/debugging purposes, the intermediate workflow-analysis checkpoint is written as
`githound_WorkflowAnalysis_<orgId>.json`.

## Enterprise Collection Foundation

GitHound now includes a minimal enterprise collection foundation through `Git-HoundEnterprise`.
That collector currently creates:

- `GH_Enterprise`
- lightweight `GH_Organization` stub nodes for member organizations
- `GH_Contains` edges from the enterprise to its organizations

Enterprise user collection through `Git-HoundEnterpriseUser` adds:

- `GH_User`
- `GH_HasMember` edges from the enterprise to those users

Enterprise SAML collection through `Git-HoundEnterpriseSamlProvider` adds:

- `GH_SamlIdentityProvider`
- `GH_ExternalIdentity`
- `GH_HasSamlIdentityProvider` from the enterprise to the provider
- the same identity-correlation edges used by the organization SAML collector

This path requires a PAT-backed session because GitHub exposes enterprise SAML through
`enterprise.ownerInfo`.

Enterprise team collection through `Git-HoundEnterpriseTeam` adds:

- `GH_EnterpriseTeam`
- `GH_AssignedTo` edges from enterprise teams to assigned organizations
- `GH_MemberOf` edges from enterprise teams to org-visible `ent:` `GH_Team` nodes using property matching
- enterprise-team `members` roles and `GH_HasRole` edges from users to those roles

Enterprise role collection through `Git-HoundEnterpriseRole` adds:

- `GH_EnterpriseRole`
- `GH_Contains` edges from the enterprise to those roles
- `GH_HasRole` edges from directly assigned users and enterprise teams
- a default `owners` role populated from `enterprise.ownerInfo.admins` when PAT-backed enterprise admin data is available

For now, raw enterprise permission strings are preserved on the `GH_EnterpriseRole` node in its `permissions` property rather than being expanded into dedicated permission edges.

Enterprise SCIM collection currently adds:

- `SCIM_User`
- `SCIM_Group`
- `SCIM_Provisioned` from `SCIM_User` to `GH_ExternalIdentity`
- `SCIM_Provisioned` from `SCIM_Group` to `GH_EnterpriseTeam` when GitHub exposes the enterprise team `group_id`
- `SCIM_MemberOf` from `SCIM_User` to `SCIM_Group`

This gives GitHound a provider-agnostic bridge from the shared SCIM schema into GitHub's native enterprise identity and team model.

When a collected `GH_SamlIdentityProvider` identifies the upstream IdP, GitHound can also add provider-aware SCIM correlation edges inside the SCIM sidecar output:

- `Okta_User -> SCIM_User`
  - matched by `Okta_User.id = SCIM_User.externalId`
- `Okta_Group -> SCIM_Group`
  - matched by `Okta_Group.name = SCIM_Group.externalId`
  - and `Okta_Group.oktaDomain = GH_SamlIdentityProvider.foreign_environmentid`

GitHound keeps the SCIM layer in its own sidecar output so these mappings remain visible without mixing SCIM-native nodes into the main GitHub-native enterprise graph:

- `githound_<entId>.json` contains enterprise GitHub-native data
- `githound_scim_<entId>.json` contains SCIM-native nodes and SCIM bridge edges
- `githound_saml_<entId>.json` contains SAML and external identity data
- `githound_hybrid_<entId>.json` contains cross-model edges such as `SAML_Implements`, `SAML_HasAccount`, and `GH_SyncedTo`
- `githound_saml_<entId>.json` also contains the normalized SAML topology for the GitHub service provider, including `SAML_TrustsIssuer` and `SAML_HasAssertionConsumerService`

The native GitHub identity-provider model remains intact in the GitHub/SAML-native outputs:

- `GH_ExternalIdentity`
- `GH_HasExternalIdentity`
- `GH_MapsToUser`

The normalized SAML layer in `githound_hybrid_<entId>.json` now lands `SAML_HasAccount` directly on `GH_User`, while deriving `match_values` from the linked `GH_ExternalIdentity` SAML-facing properties such as `saml_identity_name_id` and `saml_identity_username`.

The `GH_Organization` stubs emitted by enterprise collection are intentionally marked
`collected = false`. They represent structural discovery from the enterprise context and are
meant to be enriched later by normal organization collection.

For enterprise-first orchestration, `Invoke-GitHoundEnterprise` will collect the supported
enterprise-scoped data, enumerate related organization installations, and then run the
existing `Invoke-GitHound` workflow for each organization in its own subdirectory under the
chosen checkpoint path.

Example:

```powershell
$session = New-GitHubJwtSession `
  -EnterpriseName "your-enterprise-slug" `
  -ClientId $clientId `
  -PrivateKeyPath $privateKeyPath `
  -InstallationId $enterpriseInstallationId `
  -PersonalAccessToken $pat

Invoke-GitHoundEnterprise -Session $session -CheckpointPath "./output/your-enterprise" -CollectAll
```

For enterprise-only testing without enumerating the related organizations:

```powershell
Invoke-GitHoundEnterprise -Session $session -CheckpointPath "./output/your-enterprise" -EnterpriseOnly
```

```cypher
(:GH_User)-[:GH_HasRole|GH_MemberOf|GH_AddMember*1..]->(:GH_RepoRole)-[:GH_AdminTo|GH_CanPush]->(:GH_Repository)
```

## Usage Examples

### What Repos does a User have Write Access to?

Find the object identifier for your target user:

```cypher
MATCH (n:GH_User)
RETURN n
```

HINT: Select Table Layout

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ddfd075-2a15-4aa9-bad7-74c43e6c82d6>

Replace the `<object_id>` value in the subsequent query with the user's object identifier:

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GH_User {objectid:"<object_id>"})-[:GH_MemberOf|GH_AddMember|GH_HasRole|GH_HasBaseRole|GH_Owns*1..]->(:GH_RepoRole)-[:GH_WriteRepoContents]->(:GH_Repository)
RETURN p
```

![User to Repos](./Documentation/images/user-repo.png)

### Who has Write Access to a Repo?

Obtain the object identifier for your target repository:

```cypher
MATCH (n:GH_Repository)
RETURN n
```

Take the object identifier for your target repository and replace the `<object_id>` value in the subsequent query with it:

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GH_User)-[:GH_MemberOf|GH_HasRole|GH_HasBaseRole|GH_Owns|GH_AddMember*1..]->(:GH_RepoRole)-[:GH_WriteRepoContents]->(:GH_Repository {objectid:"<object_id>"})
RETURN p
```

![Repo to Users](./Documentation/images/who-repo.png)

### Members of the Organization Admins (Domain Admin equivalent)?

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GH_User)-[:GH_HasRole|GH_HasBaseRole]->(:GH_OrgRole {short_name: "owners"})
RETURN p
```

![Org Admins](./Documentation/images/org-admins.png)

### Users that are managed via SSO (Entra-only)

```cypher
MATCH p = (:AZUser)-[:GH_SyncedTo]->(:GH_User)
RETURN p
```

![SSO Users](./Documentation/images/sso-users.png)

### Cross-Cloud Attack Paths: GitHub to Azure

Find GitHub entities that can assume Azure federated identities (OIDC trust relationships):

```cypher
// All GitHub → Azure OIDC attack paths
MATCH p = (:GH_Repository|GH_Branch|GH_Environment)-[:GH_CanAssumeIdentity]->(:AZFederatedIdentityCredential)
RETURN p

// Users with paths to Azure via GitHub Actions
MATCH p = (:GH_User)-[:GH_HasRole|GH_MemberOf|GH_AddMember*1..]->(:GH_RepoRole)-[:GH_CanPush]->(:GH_Repository)-[:GH_CanAssumeIdentity]->(:AZFederatedIdentityCredential)

```

### Which Repositories Have Access to Organization Secrets?

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GH_Repository)-[:GH_HasSecret]->(:GH_OrgSecret)
RETURN p
```

### Repositories with Secret Scanning Alerts

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GH_Repository)-[:GH_Contains]->(:GH_SecretScanningAlert)
RETURN p
```
