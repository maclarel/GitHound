# <img src="../Icons/gh_appinstallation.png" width="50"/> GH_AppInstallation

Represents a GitHub App installed on an organization. App installations have specific permissions and can be scoped to all repositories or a selection of repositories. The permissions granted to the app are captured as a JSON string in the properties.

Each installation is linked to its parent [GH_App](GH_App.md) via a [GH_InstalledAs](../EdgeDescriptions/GH_InstalledAs.md) edge. For installations with `repository_selection` set to `all`, [GH_CanAccess](../EdgeDescriptions/GH_CanAccess.md) edges are created to every repository in the organization. For installations with `repository_selection` set to `selected`, repository-level edges cannot be enumerated with a PAT (requires app installation token authentication).
