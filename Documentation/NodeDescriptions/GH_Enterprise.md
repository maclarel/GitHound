Enterprise collection currently emits lightweight `GH_Organization` stub nodes for member organizations and links them with `GH_Contains`. Those organization nodes are intended to be enriched later by full organization collection. Enterprise user collection adds `GH_HasMember` edges from the enterprise to discovered `GH_User` nodes in traditional-account environments, and to `GH_EnterpriseManagedUser` nodes in enterprise-managed-user environments. Enterprise-managed users then map back to `GH_User` with `GH_MapsToUser`. Enterprise team collection adds `GH_EnterpriseTeam` nodes, links them with `GH_Contains`, and models organization assignment separately with `GH_AssignedTo`. Enterprise role collection adds `GH_EnterpriseRole` nodes, links them with `GH_Contains`, captures direct user and enterprise-team role assignments with `GH_HasRole`, and uses a default `owners` role to represent enterprise admins discovered through `ownerInfo.admins`.
